This is a Drupal 7 module to display a block of a 'currently reading' booklist extracted from a social booklist site.

I see this as particularly useful for personal websites and blogs so this uses site-wide rather than user-configurable settings.

Currently available: [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/api) - a book review widget for each book on the currently-reading shelf.
